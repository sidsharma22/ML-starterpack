# ML-starterpack

## Pack1 Contains:
Solving a regression problem with:
 m -> Number of observsations in the dataset 
 n -> Number of features 
 Linear regression normalized solution O(mn^2)
 Batch Gradient descent O(mn)
 Ridge Regression O(mn)
 
We will also see the impact of feature scaling on the gradient convergence. To study about the impact theoritically refer: https://jermwatt.github.io/machine_learning_refined/notes/9_Feature_engineer_select/9_3_Scaling.html
